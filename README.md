## What is DoubleVision?

DoubleVision is a photography feedback community where you can:
- Upload your photos and receive detailed critiques from other photographers
- Review others' photos and earn reputation for providing quality feedback
- Build your skills through an ELO-based rating system
- Improve your photography through honest, constructive criticism

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Your Photos
Share your photography work to receive feedback from the community. Each upload requires you to review 5 photos from others.

### 2. Review Others' Work
Provide honest, constructive feedback (minimum 50 words) on photos assigned to you. Rate each photo on a 0-100 scale to help photographers understand their strengths and areas for improvement.

### 3. Earn Reputation
Quality reviewers earn higher ELO ratings, unlocking the ability to review more photos and building credibility in the community.

## Community Guidelines

### Writing Good Reviews
- **Be Specific**: Point out what works and what doesn't with technical details
- **Be Constructive**: Offer suggestions for improvement, not just criticism
- **Be Honest**: Give genuine feedback, not generic praise
- **Minimum 50 Words**: Reviews should be detailed and thoughtful

### Content Moderation
All reviews are moderated by AI to ensure they:
- Are relevant to photography
- Provide constructive feedback
- Aren't offensive or abusive
- Aren't AI-generated or spam

**Strike System**: Violating guidelines results in strikes:
- **1st Strike**: Warning notification
- **2nd Strike**: Second warning
- **3rd Strike**: 7-day timeout from submitting reviews
